[Subagent Task Completed]

I have implemented the scaffold for 'lonely-trek':

1.  **Structure**: Explored and confirmed `src` structure.
2.  **Constants**: Updated `src/core/Constants.js` with `GAME`, `WORLD` (gravity, wind), `PLAYER` (speed, energy, colors), and `COLORS`.
3.  **GameState**: Updated `src/core/GameState.js` to track `warmth`, `isHuddling`, `isWindy` alongside `distance` (mapped to `score`).
4.  **Penguin Entity**: Created `src/entities/Penguin.js` extending `Phaser.GameObjects.Container`.
    - Implemented `walk()` and `huddle()` logic.
    - Added visual placeholders (body + belly + beak).
    - Implemented `applyWind()` for mechanics.
5.  **Game Scene**: Updated `src/scenes/GameScene.js`.
    - Implemented parallax background (infinite scrolling mountains).
    - Added Player and Ground with Physics.
    - Implemented Input handling (hold to huddle).
    - Implemented Game Loop:
        - Wind system (random intervals/durations).
        - Energy/Warmth drain (increased by wind, regenerated by huddling).
        - Distance tracking (based on velocity).
        - Game Over trigger when warmth <= 0.
    - Simple HUD for debugging (Warmth/Distance/Wind status).
    - Events: Emits `GAME_OVER` and `SCORE_CHANGED`.

The game logic is now in place for the "Lonely Trek" mechanics. No separate HUD scene was created; a simple text overlay is used in `GameScene`. The game state persists correctly to the Game Over screen.
